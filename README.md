# openSUSE Developer Mentoring Program
openSUSE is a community project to promote the use of Linux everywhere!
We believe that the best results come from people collaborating and having fun.
This project is our approach to centralize a collection of project ideas for programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/), [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) or [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/).

## Development
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

### Adding new project
1. Copy a file project file from the ``_posts`` folder and rename it to ``{date}-project-{project-name}``
2. Fill the fields in the copied file accordingly
3. Run ``jekyll serve`` and check in the browser on ``0.0.0.0:4000`` if the site looks like expected
4. Send a Pull Request
