CloudCV began in the summer of 2013 as a research project within the Machine Learning and Perception lab at Virginia Tech (now at Georgia Tech), with the ambitious goal of making platforms to make AI research more reproducible. We’re a young community working towards enabling developers, researchers, and fellow students to build, compare and share state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.

We have participated in the past three installments of Google Summer of Code, over the course of which our students built several excellent tools and features. If you are interested in participating as a student or mentor, scroll down to check out our projects and get involved! We are more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding CloudCV, so feel free to reach out to us on our <a href="https://gitter.im/Cloud-CV"><b>Gitter</b></a> channel or on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv"><b>mailing list</b></a>.
