The goal of this project is to provide challenge hosts and participants with insightful analytics to track their progress on the platform. This project will involve writing REST APIs, plotting relevant graphs, and building analytics dashboards for both challenge hosts and participants. The analytics will help challenge hosts view the progress of participants in their challenge, and participants will be able to visualize the performance of all their submissions over time and their corresponding rank on the leaderboard.
