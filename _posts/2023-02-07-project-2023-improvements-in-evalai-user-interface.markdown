The goal of this project is to improve the overall user experience for challenge hosts and participants on EvalAI by allowing them to tag and filter challenges and creating an intuitive and informative leaderboard. This project will involve creating - a comprehensive search feature to find challenges, a tagging system for different challenge types (ex: Computer Vision, NLP, etc) for categorization. This will help participants and challenge hosts find challenges and search for related ones based on tags.  An improved leaderboard, along with the search feature, will help in streamlining the process of organizing challenges, participating in challenges, and ranking participants. In addition, we will also work on adding support for relevant metadata for each challenge such as prize money, sponsors, etc.
