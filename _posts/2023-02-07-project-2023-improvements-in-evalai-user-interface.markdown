The goal of this project is to improve the overall user experience for challenge hosts and participants on EvalAI. This project involves building features like - a comprehensive search feature to find a challenge, tagging challenge type (ex: Computer Vision, NLP, etc) for categorization in order to streamline the process of organizing, participating, and navigating to challenges. This will allow challenge hosts to categorize their challenges, making it easier for participants to find and participate in relevant challenges. In addition, we will also work on adding support for relevant metadata for each challenge such as prize money, sponsors, etc.
