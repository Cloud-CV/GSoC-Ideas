As the number of compute-intensive challenges on EvalAI are increasing, we want to focus on improving the performance of our services. As a first step, we will focus on monitoring and measuring all key metrics of our services. Insights from these will allow us to efficiently utilize our infrastructure, improve uptime and reduce costs. The project will concentrate on writing REST APIâ€™s, plotting pretty graphs and building analytics dashboards to cater for all three types of users on EvalAI i.e. admin, challenge hosts and participants. The analytics will help challenge hosts to view the progress of participants in their challenge for instance, comparing the trends of the accuracy from participant submissions over the period of time, etc. The final goal is to provide users with several analytics so as to display their progress on the platform and utilize the resources efficiently to reduce costs.
