As the number of challenges on EvalAI are increasing, we want to focus on improving the performance of our services. As a first step, we will focus on monitoring and measuring all the key metrics of our services. Insights from these will allow us to efficiently utilize our infrastructure, improve uptime and reduce costs. The project will concentrate on setting up metric reporting and alerts infrastructure, writing REST APIâ€™s, plotting relevant graphs and building analytics dashboards to help EvalAI admins maintain and monitor the services.
