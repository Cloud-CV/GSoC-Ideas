This project will focus on building an infrastructure to allow exposing models submitted to EvalAI as demos in order to collect adversarial data for the model. As part of the project, we will integrate Gradio with our code upload challenge pipeline to allow deploying the models as web services. Additionally, this web service will record all interactions to curate a "in-the-wild" dataset for each submission.
