This project will focus on building a robust test suite for EvalAI's functionalities and optimizing infrastructure cost. As part of the project we will focus on making EvalAI robust and less error-prone by adding test cases for different frontend and backend component. It will involve adding unit tests for the API suite, prediction upload evaluation workers, code upload evaluation workers (on EKS) and integration tests for the end to end testing of all the components. Additionally, we will also focus on using the EvalAI monitoring setup to identify and deploy infra cost optimization features.
