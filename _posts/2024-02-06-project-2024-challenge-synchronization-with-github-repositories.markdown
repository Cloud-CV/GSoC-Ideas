This project focuses on streamlining the migration of legacy challenges on EvalAI by transitioning from challenge zip files to GitHub repositories. It involves creating GitHub repositories for hosts, copying over relevant files, and ensuring compatibility for various challenge types.
Additionally, the bidirectional sync functionality aims to seamlessly update information between EvalAI and GitHub, enabling hosts to make edits on EvalAI that reflect on GitHub repositories and vice versa. By achieving enhanced compatibility and synchronization, the project aims to provide a more efficient experience for hosts managing challenges on EvalAI.
